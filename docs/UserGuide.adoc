== Introduction

Event Manager is made with the residents of the Residential Colleges(RC) of the National University of Singapore(NUS). This application is for those who prefer to use a desktop application for managing events and guests. Moreover, the Event Manager offers a faster workflow *for those who prefer working with a Command Line Interface* while still retaining the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface. If you can type fast, you can work even faster with Event Manager to manager the various events in your RC, all you need is a laptop/computer to run this application. Interested?
