== Introduction

Event Manager is made for the residents of the Residential Colleges (RC) in the National University of Singapore (NUS). This application is build for those who prefer to use a desktop application for managing events and attendees. Moreover, the Event Manager offers a faster workflow *for those who prefer working with a Command Line Interface* while still retaining the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface. If you can type fast, you can work even faster with Event Manager to manage the various events in your RC! All you need is a laptop/computer to run this application. Interested?
