== PROJECT: Event Manager

---

== Overview

Event Manager is a desktop address book application used for managing events in the Halls and Residential Colleges of NUS. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to login/logout and signup for user accounts*
** What it does: allows the user log in and log out of their accounts and sign up for new ones.
** Justification: This feature allows the Event Manager to keep track of individual attendees of events.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: GSON library by Google.
