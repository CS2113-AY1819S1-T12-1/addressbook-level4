By: `CS2113T-T12-1`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `EventManagerChangedEvent` when the event manager data are changed, instead of
asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `EventManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a event) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the event manager data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `event manager`, which `Event` can reference. This would allow `event manager` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Event` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the event manager data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::authentication[]
=== Authentication
==== Current Implementation

The authentication mechanism is facilitated by the `Command` class and the `UserAccount` class.
It stores the user information, which includes username and password, using a JSON file.

New methods are added in the `Model` interface to check whether a user account exists in the JSON file, and to create new user accounts in the JSON file.
Additional methods are also added to check the login and admin status of the user.

Additionally, a `JsonUserStorage` class has been created to handle the reading, parsing and writing of the JSON file.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how authentication behaves at each step.

|===
|Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `JsonUserStorage` class will create a default JSON file in `data/users.json` that stores the basic `admin` account information.

Step 2. The user has the option to create a new account using the command `signup u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`. This will trigger the method `createUser(user)` in the `Model Manager` class, which is linked to `UserSession`.

Step 3. The user executes the command `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`. This will trigger the method `userExists(user)` in the `ModelManager` class.

Step 4. `UserSession` will prompt `JsonUserStorage` to read the JSON file and return to it the JSONObject parsed from the file.

Step 5. `UserSession` will then compare the logged username and password with the ones stored in the JSON file. If the comparisons return true, the `userExists` method will return true.

Step 6. The `currentUser` in the `Command` class will then be set and the login flag will be set to true. If the user is an admin, the admin flag will be set to true as well.

Step 7. After authentication, the user can now start using the application.

Step 8. The user can choose to log out of the application as well with the `logout` command. This command sets the login flag to false and clears `currentUser`.
|===

The sequence diagrams below describes the steps elaborated above.

image::SignupDiagram.png[width="800"]
image::LoginDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If an authentication fails, i.e. credentials are wrong or do not exist in the JSON file, the `login` command will throw a `CommandException`.

[IMPORTANT]
Only one admin account is registered at any given time, with `admin` and `root` being used as username and password respectively.

==== Password encryption
Allows passwords to be encrypted instead of being stored as plain text. Password encryption and validating is done through the `PasswordUtil` class using the _PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1_ encryption algorithm. +

The encrypted password consists of a randomly generated salt and a hash generated from the plain text password, both converted to hexadecimal before being stored inside `users.json`.

==== Design Considerations
* Instead of encrypting each user's password, we initially considered encrypting the entire `users.json` file instead. However, after careful consideration, we decided that it would be sub-optimal due to the
inefficiency of having to constantly encypt and decrypt the files while the application is running.
* Instead of having the authentication feature being a part of the `logic` component, we initially considered having `authentication` as a component of its own, which precedes the entire running of the `MainApp`. However,
we decided that it would introduce redundancies in the codebase as it requires rewriting a handful of functionalities that are already present within the `logic` component, thus we opted for our current implementation.

// end::authentication[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEventManager`.
It extends `EventManager` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `eventManagerStateList` and
`currentStatePointer`
.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedEventManager#commit()` -- Saves the current event manager state in its history.
* `VersionedEventManager#undo()` -- Restores the previous event manager state from its history.
* `VersionedEventManager#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone event manager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitEventManager()`, `Model#undoEventManager()` and `Model#redoEventManager()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedEventManager` will be initialized with the
initial event manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single event manager state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th event in the event manager. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitEventManager()`, causing the modified state of the event manager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `eventManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted event manager state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Party ...` to add a new event. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitEventManager()`, causing another modified event manager state to be saved into the `eventManagerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitEventManager()`, so the event manager state will not be saved into the `eventManagerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the event was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoEventManager()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once
to the left, pointing it to the previous event manager state, and restores the event manager to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial event manager state, then there are no previous
event manager states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoEventManager()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoEventManager()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the event manager to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `eventManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest event manager state,
then there are no undone event manager states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoEventManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the event manager, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#commitEventManager()`, `Model#undoEventManager()` or `Model#redoEventManager()`. Thus, the
`eventManagerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitEventManager()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `eventManagerStateList`, all event manager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged.

We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Party ...` command. This is the behavior
that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire event manager.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the event being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of event manager states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both
`HistoryManager` and `VersionedEventManager`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]


// tag::comments[]
=== Comments
==== Current Implementation

The comments feature is facilitated by `Comments` class in the Logic/Comments folder. `AddComment`, `DeleteComment` and `ReplyComment` classes extend the `Comments` class. `CommentFacade` class creates objects of `AddComment`, `DeleteComment` and `ReplyComment`. The features of the following classes are as such:

* `Comments` -- Handles storage of comments, contains `initComments(String input)` to reformat comment section to HTML, `parseCommentSection(String input)` to format the comment section into a vector and `rewrite(Vector commentsVector)` to obtain the edited comment section.

* `AddComment` -- Adds a new comment to the end of the comment section with the `addComment(String comment, String username)`

* `DeleteComment` -- Deletes a comment given the line parameter in `deleteComment(int line)`

* `ReplyComment` -- Replies a comment given the line parameter in `replyComment(String comment, int line, String username)`

* `CommentFacade` -- An implementation of the Facade design pattern to interact with AddCommentCommand, DeleteCommentCommand and ReplyCommentCommand. It contains addComment(String input, String comment, String username) to be used in AddCommentCommand to add a comment, deleteComment(String input, int line) to be used in DeleteCommentCommand to delete a comment and replyComment(String input, int line, String comment) to be used in ReplyCommentCommand to reply comments.

The Command Line Interface uses `AddCommentCommand`, `DeleteCommentCommand`, `ReplyCommentCommand` and `EditCommand` for the user to interact with the comment section. The features of the following classes are as such:

* `AddCommentCommand` -- Adds a comment using `CommentFacade` and `AddCommentCommandParser`

* `DeleteCommentCommand` -- Deletes a comment using `CommentFacade` and `DeleteCommentCommandParser`

* `ReplyCommentCommand` -- Replies to a comment using `CommentFacade` and `ReplyCommentCommandParser`

* `EditCommand` -- Resets the whole comment section using `editEventDescriptor` and `EditCommandParser`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Comments mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, logs in and click on an event or types `select INDEX` into the CLI. The comment section will be seen along with other details in the `BrowserPanel`.

Step 2. The user/admin executes `addComment 1 C/May I ask, what is the attire for the event?` to add a comment to the 1st event in the Event Manager. `AddCommentCommand` command obtains the comment section from `eventmanager.xml` calls `CommentFacade` to add comment "May I ask, what is the attire for the event", into the comment section and stores the comment section into `eventmanager.xml`

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddCommentCommand operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for AddCommentCommand
image::addCommentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[Note]
====
*Detailed description of diagram*: The user inputs "addComment 1 C/Hi". `LogicManager#execute("addComment 1 C/Hi")` and calls `EventManagerParser#parseCommand("addComment 1 C/Hi")`. Then, `AddCommentCommandParser#parse("1 C/Hi")` will be called and `AddCommentCommand#execute()` will obtain the event needed from `eventmanager.xml`. Finally, `CommandFacade#addComment` will be called and `AddComment#addComment` will process and add the new comment into the comment section. After all this, results will be returned to the various receivers and display an updated comments section to the user.

The `replyComment` and `deleteComment` command does similar methods and need not be elaborated.
====

Step 3. The user/admin executes `replyComment 1 L/1 C/Athletic attire` to reply the comment in step 2. `ReplyCommentCommand` command obtains the comment section from `eventmanager.xml` calls `CommentFacade` to reply comment with "Athletic attire", into the comment section and stores the comment section into `eventmanager.xml`

Step 4. The admin executes `deleteComment 1 L/1` to delete a comment at index 1, line 1 of comment section. `DeleteCommentCommand` command obtains the comment section from `eventmanager.xml` calls `CommentFacade` to delete "Athletic attire" from the comment section and stores the comment section into `eventmanager.xml`

Step 5. If the admin wants to reset or make a new comment section of an event, the valid command of `edit INDEX C/{span}Comment Section{/span}{ol}{/ol}` can be used

[NOTE]
====
* If a command's syntax is wrong, the application will prompt the user to try again and suggest a relevant format to follow.
* In the case a false indexed event is not present, the functions will return an invalid index message.
* In the case a false comment section line is given, the functions will return an invalid line message.
 If the user uses the `find` command, the following functions will follow the indexing of the `find` command.
====

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How comment section is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Comment section stored in a single field in `eventmanager.xml`
** Pros: Comment section will be easy to parse because only one field is used for comment section.
** Cons: If a developer wants to manipulate specific comments through eventmanager.xml file, there is no functions created for it.
* **Alternative 2:** Store each comment as a seperate field and extract each comment individually.
** Pros: No HTML tags will be stored in the field.
** Cons: New methods or data structures will need to be implemented to make many fields for comments.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the comment function commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A vector is used to store the comment section to add, insert or delete relevant comments.
** Pros: A simple data structure that has vector.add() and vector.delete() methods to help edit the comment section easily.
** Cons: Additional method is needed to parse the comment section into a vector.
* **Alternative 2:** An arrayList or List
** Pros: Library functions can help parse the comment section into the arrayList.
** Cons: More code is needed to simply insert or delete elements inside the data structure.

// end::comments[]

// tag::rsvp[]
=== RSVP
==== Current Implementation
The RSVP feature consists of the `register` & `unregister` command. The implementations of the commands use the `EditEventDescriptor` class and `createEditedEvent` method from `EditCommand` to aid in updating event attendance. Attendees of an event are stored in the `eventmanager.xml` file, in a similar fashion to the storage of tags.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the RSVP mechanism behaves:

Step 1: The user launches the application, clicks on an event or types `select 2` into the CLI. Details of the 2nd event including event attendance are displayed.

Step 2: The user executes `register 2` to register for the 2nd event. The `register` command takes in the current model and event at index 2, getting the username of the current user via `Model#getUsername()`, and the current attendance of the event as a `HashSet` with `Event#getAttendance`.

Step 3: The `register` command tries to add the username into the current attendance with `add()`. If the username already exists in the attendance, a `CommandException` is thrown. Else, `EditCommand#EditEventDescriptor` is used with the new attendance to create an edited event.

Step 4: The model is updated and committed, overwriting `eventmanager.xml`. The event page is reloaded to display the new event attendance.

Step 5: If the user decides to unregister from the event, the user executes `unregister 2`, and the `unregister` command gets the username and attendance in the same manner as the `register` command in Step 2.

Step 6: The `unregister` command tries to remove the username from the current attendance with `remove()`. If the username does not exist in the attendance, a `CommandException` is thrown. Else, `EditCommand#EditEventDescriptor` is used with the new attendance to create an edited event.

Step 7: The model is updated and committed as in Step 3, and the event page is again reloaded.

[NOTE]
`TreeSet` is used when retrieving the attendance for display as it allows for easy sorting of attendee usernames. Usernames are sorted in case-insensitive order.

The following sequence diagram shows how the register operation works:

image::registerSD.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to display attendance
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display event attendance list
** Pros: Can see which other users are attending the event
** Cons: More complex to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Display whether current user is registered for an event
** Pros: Easier to implement, user can easily see whether they are registered
** Cons: New methods will need to be implemented to make many fields for comments.

===== Aspect: Where to store attendance
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Attendance stored in `eventmanager.xml` in similar fashion to tags.
** Pros: Methods for parsing tags can be applied to parse attendance
** Cons: Inefficient to retrieve list of events which a user has registered for
* **Alternative 2:** Store with user details
** Pros: Can easily check which events a user has registered for.
** Cons: Inefficient to check which users are attending an event.

===== Aspect: How to store attendance
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Attendance stored in unsorted order.
** Pros: Easy to add new attendee to attendance.
** Cons: Requires sorting whenever attendance is displayed.
* **Alternative 2:** Attendance stored in sorted order.
** Pros: No need to sort each time an event is reloaded.
** Cons: More complexity for inserting in correct location.
// end::rsvp[]

//tag::eventStatus&Reminder[]
=== Event Status and Reminders
==== Current Implementation
The Event Status and Reminder feature consists of two commands periodically executed by `LogicManager`. Specifically, the `UpdateStatusCommand` and the `ReminderCommand`. The automated process is facilitated by the `Timer` and `TimerTask` classes in the `java.util` package. The `TimerTask` `updateEventStatus` has a period of 300,000 ms where it will execute an instance of the `UpdateStatusCommand`, while the `TimerTask` `checkEventReminders` has a period of 36,000,000 ms where it will execute an instance of the `ReminderCommand`.

Both commands initially calls the model#getFilteredEventList() method to obtain the displayed list of events as `lastShownList`.

The *UpdateStatusCommand* updates the status of each event in the `lastShownList` using `Status#setStatus()` and `model#updateEvent()`. It then refreshes the displayed list by calling `model#updateFilteredEventList()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the UpdateStatusCommand works:

.Sequence Diagram for UpdateStatusCommand
image::Update-sequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The Event Status feature is supported by the `Status` and `DateTime` field in the `Event`. Events with `DateTime` fields before the current `Date` will assume the `COMPLETED Status`, whereas those with `DateTime` fields after the current `Date` will take on the `UPCOMING Status`.

The *ReminderCommand* checks for the following in each event:
=====
. `checkAttendeeKeywordsMatchEventAttendee` -- checks if the current user is registered as an attendee
. `checkEventIsUpcoming` -- checks if the event is upcoming (happening in the next 24 hours)
=====

If the two conditions are satisfied, a `sendEventReminder` event containing the event's name and starting time is used to communicate with the `UiManager` to show an alert dialog using `Ui#showAlertDialogAndWait()` to display the event's information.

The following sequence diagram shows how the ReminderCommand works:

.Sequence Diagram for ReminderCommand
image::Reminder-sequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Automated or user-enabled commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Status updates and reminders automated using `Timer`.
** Pros: Takes the updating and checking tasks off users. Less reliance on users' end also means that updates and reminders are executed more regularly.
** Cons: Uses up more processing resources.
* **Alternative 2:** Users have to run status updates and reminders checking.
** Pros: Ensures that the updated status or reminders are provided to users when they want it.
** Cons: Users may be looking at very outdated statuses and will not receive reminders if they forget to check for it.

===== Aspect: Where to implement the update and reminder command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Both features are subclass of the `Command` superclass.
** Pros: Easier implementation since there are already methods to execute commands. This implementation also allows users to call the commands if necessary.
** Cons: Both features are not really commands that should be executed by the user and thus should not be subclasses of `Command`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new class in `LogicManager` which is responsible for the execution.
** Pros: The `TimerTask` could be implemented in the command and the `UpdateStatusCommand` and `ReminderCommand` need only be called once. This also decreases the coupling with `MainApp` and `EventManagerParser`.
** Cons: A new method for executing the two commands would be required and the user would not be able to call for a status update should the need arise.

===== Aspect: How to implement the status update
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implemented using pre-existing codes such as `EditEventDescriptor` and `model#updateEvent()`.
** Pros: No need to add new codes for the implementation and add unnecessary complexities into the project code.
** Cons: Inefficient method to update only the status since every other field in the event has to be copied over each time the status is updated.
* **Alternative 2:** Write a `Event#setStatus()` method to update the status.
** Pros: More efficient way of updating the statuses of events thus reducing the consumption of processing resources.
** Cons: More lines of codes required and also adds to the complexity of the project code.

===== Aspect: Whether to add implementation to allow users to set reminders
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reminders are automatically sent to users who registered for an event.
** Pros: Saves users the trouble of having to set the reminders themselves.
** Cons: Users cannot unsubscribe to the reminders for events that they have registered for.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to set reminders as they wish.
** Pros: Users who do not want reminders can refuse to set reminders.
** Cons: Users would have to set their own reminders. Some users may choose to save themselves the trouble of setting reminders and miss the events they have registered for.
//end::eventStatus&Reminder[]

//tag::sorting[]
=== Default sorting
==== Current Implementation
Since our product is an event manager, events should be controlled and view in chronological order.
To do this, `UniqueEventList` class was modified so as to sort the event list in Date order, follow by Name order. +

Consider this scenario:

Step 1: User launches application, then logs in

Step 2: User adds a new event which will occur before some of the other events in the list +
e.g: `add n/Jack Birthday Party ... d/10/10/2018 20:30...`

Step 3: When add method is called, it performs the intended operation, then sorts the list before returning it to other components.

Step 4: The event list panel is reloaded and displays the newly added event in the correct place.

==== Aspect: How to sort the list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Event list will be sorted based on sort method implemented in `UniqueEventList` class to modify the internal list which event manager is backed on.
** Pros: Easy to implement with minimum modification that could affect other components.
** Cons: Every method that changes the internal list (e.g: add, setEvent, delete) will need to implement the sorting method again at the end of the method.

* **Alternative 2:** Sort only when we need to get the list if the list is not sorted.
** Pros: The easiest implementation without affecting other components.
** Cons: The sort operation when called by other components, for example the UI component, will return operations to the main thread, which will severely affect testing with JUnit on JavaFX thread.

* **Alternative 3:** Only sort the list for displaying on the UI
** Pros: Will perform minimal operation while still returning what we need to observe.
** Cons: Very complicated implementation as the UI is updated based on observing internal list. We will need a class to update the UI if we only want to sort the list on display.
// end::sorting[]

// tag::findEnhancement[]
=== Enhance current find command
==== Current Implementation
`find` command is used for better navigation. Therefore, it is enhanced to search for more properties in an Event. +

`find` can search for any data with the default keywords and . If specific prefixes are added, find can search for events that must contain that keyword in the specific fields.

[NOTE]
If there are more than 1 prefixes of the same type, for example, `find n/new n/dark n/meeting`, they will be automatically combined together, which means that this command will be assumed to be the same as `find n/new dark meeting`. +
Current version implementation uses logic AND operator for different prefixes.

==== Aspect: How to improve search
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Modify the predicate to display the events that contain one of the keywords.
** Pros: Follows the current structure of `find` command, which means that current resources can be reused.
** Cons: With the current implementation of the predicate, scaling will severely affect product performance.

==== Future enhancement:
* Search options for keywords contained or for the exact keywords.
* Search with  both `logic AND and OR operator` with different prefixes.
* Search for events within a time range.
//end::findEnhancement[]

// tag::exportcalendar[]
=== Export RVSP-ed events to iCalendar file
==== Current implementation
This feature will increase the compatibility of Event Manager with other calendar app for better planning.

Consider the following scenario:

Step 1: User launches the application, then logs in.

Step 2: User executes `export my event calendar` command. The export command receive argument to accept as filename

Step 3: Current user, who is logged in, will be used to receive an event filtered list that he/she has registered for.

Step 4: A FileOutputStream will be created to create new file/re-write if the file exists with the data from the filtered event list converted to iCalendar file format

==== Aspect: How to export the event list
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Using ical4j external library to create methods to convert events to RFC5545 format, then stream to FileOutputStream with given filename from user. +
All method are written in the `ExportCalendarCommand` class.
** Pros: Easy to implement, can reuse current resources and easy to match wth the implementation of Attendance list.
** Cons: Violates some of the OOP design as the export method should be in the storage class.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a class to write an .ics file with given RFC5545 standard.
** Pros: Have better control of the output file, since the ical4j support API has not been updated for a long time and currently shows some areas which are lacking.
** Cons: Very complicated and time consuming.

[NOTE]
====
Calendar will be exported to your src/data folder.
====

==== [Proposed]: Future enhancement
Export should be able to export the attendance list of an event according to user preference.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
[[Implementation-Configuration]]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, event manager depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml
.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
